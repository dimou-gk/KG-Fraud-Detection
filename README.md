# 🧠 Credit Card Fraud Detection via Knowledge Graphs & Centrality-Based Features 💳🔍

This repository contains the full implementation of my **Bachelor Thesis Research** on enhancing Credit Card Fraud Detection (CCFD) through **graph-based analysis** and **machine learning**.

By modeling transactions as a **Knowledge Graph**, we extracted **centrality-based features**, including weighted variants, to enrich traditional feature sets. These were then fed into a variety of classifiers, including **XGBoost**, **Bagging**, and others, achieving state-of-the-art performance on a real-world dataset.

   abstract="Detecting fraudulent activity in credit card transactions poses a serious challenge for financial institutions, which requires robust techniques that can accurately pinpoint fraudulent occurrences           while minimizing false positives. In this study, we introduce an innovative strategy to enhance Credit Card Fraud Detection (CCFD) by utilizing Knowledge Graphs and Centrality measures. We propose
      creating a Knowledge Graph (KG) representing the credit card transaction network so as to capture connections and correlations between the transactions, and analyzing the KG to evaluate centrality
      measures that capture the importance of nodes and relationships within the graph. These centrality measures are utilized to enhance the input features that are used to train Machine Learning
      classifiers for fraud detection. Our experiments show that using the enhanced features significantly improved classification performance, providing better identification of fraudulent transactions,
      especially through the combination of HITS and degree centrality.",
